# Labs #3 Array of Objects

## 1.2 Create, insert, and display Array of Object

The solution is implemented in Rectangle.java & ArrayoOfObject.java, and below is screenshot of the result.

**Brief explanaton:** There are 4 main step: 

*Rectangle.java:*
1. Declare the two variables which is width and height as an integer.

*ArrayOfObject.java*
1. Create an array of the Rectangle Class.
2. Insert values of each Array's attributes.
3. Print the inserted value in the array.

**Questions:**
1. No, because the class only had an attribute, not any methods.
2. No, it is meant to instantiate each object within the array.
3. Defining an array of Rectangle objects.
4. Instantiate the Rectangle object and assign values to the width and length variables.
5. No, we can simply move the main method from ArrayOfObject.java to Rectangle.java.

## 1.3 Input Data Into Array Object Using Loops

The solution is implemented in ArrayOfObjects.java, and below is the screenshot of the result.

**Brief explanationn:** There are 4 main step:

1. Declare an array to hold Rectangle objects.
2. Use a loop to repeatedly input values for the width and length for each element in the array.
3. Use a loop to print the width and length of each rectangle.

**Questions:**
1. Yes, it is possible.
2. The rows of the array can represent the width of the rectangle, and the columns can represent the length.
3. This happens because the squareArray object has not been instantiated yet, but we are trying to input values into the array immediately.
4.

5. The previous values of the object will be overwritten and replaced with the newly instantiated object.

## 1.4 Mathematical operation in array of object's attribute

The solution is implemented in ArrayBlocks.java & Blocks.java and below is the screenshot of the result.

**Brief explanationn:** There are 4 main step:

1. Declare an array of Block objects.  
2. Input values and instantiate each object within the array.  
3. Print the volume of each block by calling the function from the Block class.

**Questions:**
1. Yes. We can put both default constructor and parameterized constructor

2-5.

## 1.5 Assignment

The solution is implemented in Lecturer16.java, LecturerData16.java & LecturerDemo16.java and below is the screenshot of the result.
