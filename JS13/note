1. The difference between single linked list and double linked list is if the single one, it only contain one pointer which is pointer to next,
    while the double one, the node contain two pointers which is pointer prev adn pointer next that connect the node before and after the said node.
2. The purposes of the attributes next and prev is both are used to connect and create link with other node before and after the said node.
3. The constructor is to initialize head and tail value to be null for DoubleLinkedList
4. Based from the line *head = tail = newNode;* in addFirst() method, it will be used if the node that get added in an empty list, the node will become the head and tail of the linked list
5. Statement *head.prev=newNode* means accesing the head node and use the head attributes prev to connect and link to the newNode.
6. Statement *temp.next.prev=newNode* means we accesing the node after the temp and use the its prev attribut /pointer to connect to the newNode.
7. Using advance traversal using next to access the node after node. for that, we use Statement *temp=temp.next* to move temp node to the next temp.
8. if the temp equal with tail, then the program will exexcute addLast() method when we insert the new data.
9. Statement if(temp.data.nim.equalsIgnoreCase(key)) is being used in the insertAfter() to process the selection of all nodes.
